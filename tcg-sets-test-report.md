   - Proper error boundaries
   - Consistent theming support
   - Reusable components

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Infinite scroll reduces initial load
   - Memoization of filtered/sorted data
   - Dynamic imports for heavy components
   - Image optimization with Next.js Image component

3. **User Experience**
   - Loading states prevent layout shifts
   - Error messages are user-friendly
   - Responsive design works well
   - Animations enhance but don't hinder

#### ❌ Issues Found:

4. **Analytics**: Track popular sets and cards

## Conclusion

The TCG Sets functionality is **fully functional** with excellent user experience. All major features work as expected:
- Search, filter, and sort capabilities are robust
- Individual set pages provide comprehensive information
- Card display and modal system work seamlessly
- Performance optimizations are in place
- Error handling is implemented properly

**Overall Grade: A**

The implementation is production-ready with minor room for enhancement features.
