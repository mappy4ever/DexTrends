# TCG Set Detail Page Timeout Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Timeout Synchronization**
   - Changed initial request timeout from 20s to 30s to match API
   - Changed batch loading timeout from 15s to 30s for consistency
   - Removed redundant timeout promise race condition

2. **Optimized Loading**
   - Increased initial page size from 50 to 100 cards
   - Reduced batch size from 2 pages to 1 page at a time
   - Added 500ms delay between batches to avoid overwhelming the API

3. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Added specific handling for timeout errors
   - Better retry button text for timeout errors
   - Store timeout state in sessionStorage for better UX

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Deferred statistics calculation using requestAnimationFrame
   - Added React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Increased retry count and delay for better reliability

## Testing

To test the fixes:
1. Navigate to a TCG set with many cards (e.g., sv10)
2. Cards should load without timeout errors
3. Loading progress should be smooth and visible
4. If a timeout occurs, the retry button should work properly

## Key Changes

- Consistent 30-second timeouts across frontend and API
- Better batch loading with delays to prevent API overload
- Improved error messages and recovery options
- Performance optimizations for smoother UX
