# TCG 100 Card Limit Fix

## Problem
- Frontend requested 1000 cards but only 100 were being displayed
- Issue was in the backend API limiting pageSize to 100

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend Fix (`/pages/api/tcg-sets/[setId].ts`)
Changed line 9 from:
```typescript
const pageSizeNum = Math.min(parseInt(...), 100); // Old limit
```
To:
```typescript
const pageSizeNum = Math.min(parseInt(...), 1000); // New limit
```

### 2. Frontend Enhancement (`/pages/tcgsets/[setid].tsx`)
Added automatic multi-page loading as a fallback:
- First attempts to load 1000 cards in one request
- If API returns `hasMore: true`, automatically loads all remaining pages
- Shows "Loading all cards..." message during multi-page load
- Safety limit of 20 pages to prevent infinite loops

### 3. Debug Logging
Added detailed console logging to show:
- Number of cards received
- Pagination info (hasMore, totalCount, etc.)
- Progress during multi-page loading

## How It Works Now

1. **Best Case**: Pokemon TCG API allows 1000 cards per page
   - All cards load in one request
   - No additional loading needed

2. **Fallback Case**: Pokemon TCG API limits responses
   - First page loads (up to API's limit)
   - System detects more cards available
   - Automatically loads all remaining pages
   - Updates UI progressively as pages load

## Testing
Check console logs for:
```
API Response Debug: {
  cardsReceived: [number],
  hasMore: [boolean],
  totalCount: [number],
  ...
}
```

If multi-page loading occurs, you'll see:
```
More cards available, loading all remaining pages...
Loading page 2...
Page 2: loaded X more cards. Total: Y
...
All cards loaded. Total: Z cards
```

## Result
- All cards in a set now load automatically
- No more 100 card limit
- No manual "Load More" button needed
- Better user experience with all cards available immediately
