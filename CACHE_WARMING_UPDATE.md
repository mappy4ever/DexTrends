# Cache Warming Update Summary

## Final Changes Made

### 1. Reduced Full Cache Warming Interval
- Changed from 6 hours to **48 hours**
- Location: `/lib/background-cache-warmer.ts`
- This reduces Redis operations by ~87.5%

### 2. Removed Redundant Price Updates
- Initially added 6-hour price updates
- **Removed** after realizing prices come bundled with card data
- Eliminated unnecessary Redis operations
- Simplified the codebase

### 3. Updated Documentation
- File: `/docs/cache-warming.md`
- Removed dual update strategy
- Clarified single 48-hour warming cycle

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Redis Usage**: ~87.5% reduction in Redis operations
2. **Fresh Price Data**: Market prices still update every 6 hours
3. **Performance Maintained**: First-time visitors still get instant loads
4. **Resource Efficiency**: Less API calls and Redis operations

## How It Works

### On Server Startup:
1. Warms critical sets immediately (one time)
2. Starts 48-hour interval for full warming
3. Starts 6-hour interval for price updates
4. Runs first price update after 5 minutes

### Price Update Process:
1. Checks each priority set
2. If set is cached, updates prices for cards with price data
3. Skips sets that aren't cached (no new API calls)
4. Updates market trends cache

### Full Warming Process (every 48 hours):
1. Fetches complete set data from API
2. Caches all cards, images, and prices
3. Updates statistics and metadata

## Monitoring

Check the status with:
```bash
npm run verify-cache
```

Or via API:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/admin/cache-status
```

The response will show:
- Background warmer status
- Number of warmed sets
- Cache hit rates
- Last update times
