2. **Identify Unknown Badges**:
   - Research the 5 unidentified badges (freedom, harmony, patience, pride, tranquility)
   - These may be from side games like Pokémon Masters or special events

3. **Organization Suggestions**:
   - Consider organizing into subfolders by region
   - Separate official gym badges from TCG cards and character collections

## Conclusion

The badge collection is exceptionally comprehensive with 98.8% coverage of all official gym badges. Only one anime-exclusive badge is missing. The collection also includes extensive additional content from TCG, anime character collections, and special variants, making it a thorough archive of Pokémon badge imagery.

The presence of all main series game badges (Kanto through Paldea) represents a complete collection for the core games, which is the primary achievement.
