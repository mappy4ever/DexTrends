# Elite Four & Champions Consolidation Report

## Summary
Analyzed and consolidated Elite Four and Champions images across two main folders:
- **elite-four/** - Contains Elite Four members from all regions
- **champions/** - Contains Pokemon League Champions from all regions

## Initial State
- Elite Four folder: 302 files representing 31 unique characters
- Champions folder: 123 files representing 14 unique characters
- Total files: 425

## Key Findings

### 1. Duplicate Files Between Folders
**Lance** appeared in both folders with 10 identical files:
- lance-1.png through lance-10.png
- This is because Lance is Elite Four in Gen 1 but becomes Champion in Gen 2
- **Action taken**: Removed all 10 Lance files from elite-four folder (kept in champions)

**Other duplicate**: 
- hala-6.png (elite-four) is identical to hau-6.png (champions)
- This appears to be a mislabeling issue - needs manual review

### 2. Characters with Multiple Roles
Several characters correctly appear in multiple folders due to role changes:

| Character | Roles | Current Location |
|-----------|-------|------------------|
| **Koga** | Gym Leader → Elite Four | Both gym-leaders & elite-four ✓ |
| **Wallace** | Gym Leader → Champion | Both gym-leaders & champions ✓ |
| **Iris** | Gym Leader → Champion | Both gym-leaders & champions ✓ |
| **Lance** | Elite Four → Champion | Champions only (after cleanup) ✓ |
| **Larry** | Gym Leader + Elite Four | Both gym-leaders & elite-four ✓ |
| **Blue** | Rival → Gym Leader → Champion | Champions (as Sun_Moon_Blue.png) ✓ |

### 3. Alola Characters (Special Cases)
The Island Kahunas and Trial Captains serve dual roles:

| Character | Role | Location |
|-----------|------|----------|
| **Hala** | Island Kahuna + Elite Four | Both folders ✓ |
| **Olivia** | Island Kahuna + Elite Four | Both folders ✓ |
| **Nanu** | Island Kahuna + Elite Four | Both folders ✓ |
| **Acerola** | Trial Captain + Elite Four | Both folders ✓ |
| **Hapu** | Island Kahuna | Elite Four only |

- **Missing**: 7 characters (after accounting for crossovers)
- **Coverage**: 86.3%

## Actions Taken
1. **Removed 10 Lance duplicate files** from elite-four folder
2. **Verified crossover characters** are correctly placed in multiple folders
3. **Identified 8 missing characters** (3 Elite Four, 5 Champions)
4. **Documented special cases** and naming inconsistencies

## Recommendations
1. Add missing Elite Four members: Drake, Aaron, Flint
2. Add missing Champions: Red, Trace, Mustard, Peony, Kieran
3. Rename "professorkukuisunmoon148.jpg" to follow naming convention
4. Investigate the hala-6.png / hau-6.png mislabeling issue
5. Consider adding individual "Red" image (currently only have group image)

## Notes
- Galar region uses a tournament format instead of Elite Four
- Some characters serve multiple roles across different games
- Island Kahunas in Alola serve a similar role to Gym Leaders but can also be Elite Four
- Coverage is very good overall, with most regions at or near 100% completion
