# Webpack Module Resolution Error Fix

## Problem
When navigating to PokeID pages, a webpack error appears:
```
@http://localhost:3000/_next/static/chunks/webpack.js:753:38
```

The error can be dismissed and the page continues to function.

## Root Cause
This is likely caused by:
1. Mixed JavaScript and TypeScript imports
2. Circular dependencies between utility files
3. Webpack's module resolution struggling with the ongoing TypeScript migration

## Potential Solutions

### 1. Clear Next.js Cache (Immediate Fix)
```bash
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

### 2. Check for Circular Dependencies
The error might be due to circular imports between:
- `pokemonutils.ts` 
- `pokemonTypeColors.ts`
- Components importing from both

### 3. Update Next.js Configuration
Add to `next.config.mjs`:
```javascript
webpack: (config) => {
  config.resolve.extensions = ['.ts', '.tsx', '.js', '.jsx', '.json'];
  return config;
}
```

### 4. Temporary Workaround
If the error persists but doesn't break functionality:
1. Continue with TypeScript migration
2. The error should resolve once all related files are converted
3. Users can dismiss the error for now

## Files to Check
1. `/components/ui/TypeBadge.tsx` - imports from both utilities
2. `/utils/pokemonutils.ts` - check exports
3. `/utils/pokemonTypeColors.ts` - check for duplicate exports

## Next Steps
1. Complete TypeScript migration for all Pokemon-related utilities
2. Ensure no circular dependencies
3. Test thoroughly after each batch of conversions
