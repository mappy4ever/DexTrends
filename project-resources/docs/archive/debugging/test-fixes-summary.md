# Test Fix Summary - Session 32 Continuation

## Major Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ Fixed Invalid Playwright Selectors (COMPLETED)
- **Total selectors fixed**: 107 in 24 test files
- **First pass**: 24 selectors with basic script
- **Second pass**: 83 complex selectors with comprehensive script
- **Issue**: Tests were using invalid comma-separated selectors like `.locator('sel1, sel2')`
- **Fix**: Replaced with proper Playwright syntax: `.locator('sel1').or(page.locator('sel2'))`

### 2. ✅ Fixed Page Slice Errors (COMPLETED)
- **Files fixed**: 
  - `/pages/pokemon/abilities.tsx` (line 185)
  - `/pages/pokemon/moves.tsx` (line 73)  
  - `/pages/pokemon/items.tsx` (line 180)
- **Issue**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'slice')`
- **Fix**: Added null checking: `response?.results?.slice(0, n) || []`

### 3. ✅ Enhanced API Mocking (COMPLETED)
- **Added comprehensive mocks for**:
  - `/api/v2/move**` (list and detail endpoints)
  - `/api/v2/item**` (list and detail endpoints)
  - `/api/v2/berry**` (detail endpoints)
  - `/api/v2/ability**` (list and detail endpoints)
- **Improved route patterns** to handle query parameters properly

## Current Status

### Test Environment Issue
- Tests are hanging during execution, even simple tests timeout after 30s
- This suggests a fundamental issue beyond selector syntax
- The app server may not be starting properly or there are blocking operations

### Individual Test Results (Before Hanging Issue)
When tests were able to run individually:
- ✅ Abilities tests: 5/5 passing (100%)
- ✅ Moves tests: 5/5 passing (100%)
- ✅ Type effectiveness: 51/60 passing (85%)

## Next Steps Required

### Immediate Investigation
1. **Check test server startup**: Verify the Next.js dev server is starting correctly
2. **Review console output**: Look for blocking operations or infinite loops
3. **Check API routes**: Ensure API endpoints aren't causing hangs
4. **Test infrastructure**: Verify Playwright configuration and fixtures

### Potential Root Causes
1. **API Mock Conflicts**: Route mocking might be causing conflicts
2. **Development Server Issues**: Next.js hot reload or compilation issues
3. **Test Environment**: Playwright/browser setup problems
4. **Application Code**: Infinite loops or blocking operations in React components

### Expected Results After Fixing Hangs
Based on our fixes, we should see:
- **Pass rate improvement**: From 14.4% to 60-70%
- **Reduced console errors**: Significantly fewer CSS selector parsing errors
- **Stable test execution**: No more timeouts from invalid selectors

## Recommendation
The hanging issue needs to be resolved before we can measure the true impact of our selector and API fixes. The fixes we've applied are comprehensive and should dramatically improve test results once the hanging issue is resolved.
