# Phase 4 White Page Issue - Fixed

## Issue Description
After Phase 4 optimization, the application showed a white page with the following browser console errors:
- `Failed to load resource: cannot decode raw data (webpack.js, line 0)`
- `Failed to load resource: cannot decode raw data (main.js, line 0)`
- `Failed to load resource: cannot decode raw data (_app.js, line 0)`

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the compression headers added in `next.config.mjs` during Phase 4 optimization:

```javascript
// Problematic configuration
{
  source: '/:path*.(js|css|woff|woff2|ttf|eot)',
  headers: [
    {
      key: 'Cache-Control',
      value: 'public, max-age=31536000, immutable'
    },
    {
      key: 'Content-Encoding',
      value: 'gzip'  // This was the problem!
    }
  ]
}
```

The `Content-Encoding: gzip` header was telling browsers that the JavaScript and CSS files were gzip-compressed, but Next.js doesn't actually serve gzipped files in development mode. This caused browsers to fail when trying to decode non-compressed files as gzip.

## Solution
Removed the `Content-Encoding` header from the static assets configuration in `next.config.mjs`:

```javascript
// Fixed configuration
{
  source: '/:path*.(js|css|woff|woff2|ttf|eot)',
  headers: [
    {
      key: 'Cache-Control',
      value: 'public, max-age=31536000, immutable'
    }
    // Removed Content-Encoding header
  ]
}
```

## Key Learnings
1. **Compression in Next.js**: The `compress: true` option in `next.config.mjs` handles compression automatically. Don't manually add Content-Encoding headers.
2. **Development vs Production**: Compression behavior differs between development and production builds.
3. **Browser Errors**: "cannot decode raw data" typically indicates encoding/compression mismatches.

## Verification
After removing the problematic header:
- Development server runs successfully on port 3000/3001
- No browser console errors
- Application loads correctly
- All JavaScript and CSS files load properly

## Note
The `compress: true` option in the config is sufficient for enabling gzip compression. Next.js will handle the appropriate headers automatically in production builds.
