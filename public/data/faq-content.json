    "question": "What is the purpose of this website?",
    "answer": "This website provides an interactive platform to explore and analyze Canadian federal government travel expenses. It aims to make public data more accessible and understandable, showing how funds are allocated for travel across departments, by officials, and over different time periods."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where does the data come from?",
    "answer": "The data is sourced directly from the Government of Canada's official Open Data Portal, specifically the 'Proactive Disclosure of Travel Expenses' dataset. You can find the source dataset at https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/009f9a49-c2d9-4d29-a6d4-1a228da335ce."
  },
  {
    "question": "How up-to-date is the data?",
    "answer": "The data is updated based on the release schedule of the official Government of Canada dataset. The 'About' page usually indicates the 'data current as of' date. There might be a natural reporting lag between when expenses are incurred and when they are published."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of information can I find on the Dashboard?",
    "answer": "The Dashboard provides a high-level overview, including Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) like total spending and average trip cost. It also shows spending trends over time, breakdowns by travel purpose, top spending departments, and top spending officials (e.g., Ministers) within the selected date range."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I see spending for a specific department or by traveler title?",
    "answer": "Navigate to the 'Orgs' (Organization Trends) page. Here, you can use the filters to select specific departments and traveler titles to see their spending trends and breakdowns over the chosen date range."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I see the travel expenses for a particular individual?",
    "answer": "Yes, the 'People' (Person Inspector) page allows you to search for and select specific individuals. Once selected, you can view their detailed travel expenses, trip history, and spending patterns for the filtered period."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the Map Explorer show?",
    "answer": "The 'Map' page visualizes the destinations of government travel. It helps you see where travel is concentrated geographically within the selected date range."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do the filters work?",
    "answer": "At the top of most pages, you'll find a filter bar. You can select a 'Start Date' and 'End Date' (year and month) to define the period for which you want to see data. Other relevant filters like 'Organization', 'Title', or 'Person' will be available depending on the page. Your filter selections are generally remembered as you navigate the site."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are there any limitations to the data?",
    "answer": "Yes, some limitations include: the accuracy and completeness depend on the source data; there can be reporting delays; the level of detail in expense descriptions might vary; and it's important to consider the context (e.g., traveler's role, purpose of travel) when interpreting the figures. More details are available on the 'About' page."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is this website an official Government of Canada site?",
    "answer": "No, this is an independent project created to visualize publicly available data and is not officially affiliated with the Government of Canada."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are 'Top Spending Departments' and 'Top Spending Ministers' calculated on the Dashboard?",
    "answer": "These lists are generated by aggregating the total travel expenses attributed to each department or individual official (specifically names that appear in roles like 'Minister') within the currently selected date range on the Dashboard. They represent the highest cumulative spenders for that period."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why might the data for a very recent month be incomplete?",
    "answer": "Government departments have a reporting cycle for disclosing expenses. It's common for there to be a delay of one to three months (or sometimes more) between the end of a travel period and when the full data for that period appears in the public dataset. Always check the 'data current as of' information if available."
  },
  {
    "question": "What do the different expense categories (Airfare, Lodging, Meals, etc.) mean?",
    "answer": "These categories are generally defined by the Government's travel directives. 'Airfare' covers flights, 'Lodging' is for accommodation, 'Meals' covers meal allowances, 'Other Transport' can include things like taxis, rail, or rental cars, and 'Other Expenses' might cover miscellaneous costs like conference fees or incidentals. The specifics are based on the source dataset's classifications."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I download the data from this website?",
    "answer": "This website primarily focuses on visualizing the data. To download the raw dataset, it's recommended to visit the official Government of Canada Open Data Portal page for the 'Proactive Disclosure of Travel Expenses' (link available on our 'About' page)."
