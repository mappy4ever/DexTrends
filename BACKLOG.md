# DexTrends Development Backlog

## Overview
This file tracks future work items, feature requests, and improvements that need to be implemented in the DexTrends project.

---

## High Priority

### Performance Optimizations
- [x] Implement virtual scrolling for large card lists (>100 items) ✅ COMPLETE - Multiple implementations exist (VirtualizedCardGrid, VirtualCardGrid)
- [ ] Add image lazy loading with blur-up placeholders
- [ ] Optimize bundle size - analyze and remove unused dependencies
- [ ] Implement code splitting for route-based chunks

### UI/UX Enhancements
- [ ] Add skeleton loading states for all data-fetching components
- [ ] Implement pull-to-refresh on mobile devices
- [ ] Add haptic feedback for mobile interactions
- [ ] Create smooth page transitions with shared element animations

---

## Medium Priority

### Feature Additions
- [ ] Add card comparison tool (side-by-side comparison)
- [ ] Implement advanced filtering (multiple types, HP ranges, etc.)
- [ ] Add collection tracking with statistics
- [ ] Create deck builder with validation rules

### Technical Improvements
- [ ] Migrate to Next.js App Router when stable
- [ ] Add E2E tests for critical user flows
- [ ] Implement error boundary components
- [ ] Add analytics tracking for user interactions

---

## Low Priority / Nice to Have

### Enhancements
- [ ] Add sound effects for card interactions (optional setting)
- [ ] Implement card pack opening animation
- [ ] Add AR view for cards (using device camera)
- [ ] Create community features (comments, ratings)

### Developer Experience
- [ ] Add Storybook for component documentation
- [ ] Create component generator CLI tool
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks for code quality
- [ ] Implement automated changelog generation

---

## Technical Debt

### Code Quality
- [ ] Fix remaining TypeScript 'any' types
- [ ] Remove deprecated dependencies
- [ ] Refactor large components into smaller pieces
- [ ] Standardize error handling across the app

### Testing
- [ ] Increase test coverage to >80%
- [ ] Add visual regression tests
- [ ] Implement API mocking for tests
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks

---

## Bug Fixes

### Known Issues
- [ ] Fix holographic effects not working properly in Card Detail page (/cards/[cardId])
- [ ] Fix holographic effects in CardPreviewModal (lower priority - may not be critical)
- [ ] Fix horizontal scroll on mobile for some pages
- [ ] Resolve memory leak in infinite scroll implementation
- [ ] Fix card image loading race condition
- [ ] Correct dark mode colors in certain components

---

## Notes

### Recently Completed
- ✅ Implemented 3D tilt effects for cards
- ✅ Added holographic effects tied to card rarity
- ✅ Fixed QuotaExceededError with safe storage wrapper
- ✅ Created reusable hooks for card animations

### Decision Log
- **2024-01-28**: Decided to use Claude Code over Lovable for UI enhancements due to better codebase integration
- **2024-01-28**: Implemented safe storage wrapper to handle browser storage quota limits

## How to Use This Backlog

1. **Adding Items**: Add new items under the appropriate priority section
2. **Moving Items**: When starting work on an item, move it to "In Progress" in your task manager
3. **Completing Items**: When done, move to "Recently Completed" with date
4. **Priority Levels**:
   - **High**: Critical for user experience or blocking other work
   - **Medium**: Important but not urgent
   - **Low**: Nice to have, implement when time permits

## Future Considerations

### Potential Major Features
- Pokemon battle simulator
- Trading system between users
- Tournament bracket creator
- Price prediction using ML
- Mobile app (React Native)

### Infrastructure
- Consider migrating to monorepo structure
- Evaluate serverless functions for API
- Implement CDN for static assets
- Add Redis for caching layer
