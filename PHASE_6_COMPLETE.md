- Tree shaking and dead code elimination
- SWC minification for faster builds
- Console stripping in production

#### Service Worker (PWA)
- 3-tier caching strategy (static, images, API)
- Offline-first architecture
- Background sync for queued actions
- 7-day cache expiry with auto-cleanup
- PWA installable with app icon

#### Bundle Optimization
- Lazy loading for heavy components
- Route-based code splitting
- Predictive prefetching on hover
- Error boundaries with retry logic

### Part D: E2E Testing Infrastructure ✅
Created comprehensive Playwright tests:

#### Critical User Flows (`critical-flows.spec.ts`)
- Homepage navigation to main sections
- Pokedex search and filter functionality
- Pokemon detail page information display
- TCG Expansions loading and set navigation
- Battle Simulator Pokemon selection
- Type Effectiveness chart interactions
- Team Builder Pokemon management

#### Mobile Responsiveness Tests
- Mobile navigation verification
- Touch target size validation (44px minimum)
- Responsive layout checks

#### Performance Tests
- Page load time validation (<5 seconds)
- Lazy loading verification
- Core Web Vitals monitoring

#### Accessibility Tests
- Keyboard navigation functionality
- ARIA labels presence
- Proper heading hierarchy

#### Form Component Tests (`form-components.spec.ts`)
- Select dropdown interactions
- Checkbox state toggling
- Radio button group behavior
- Form validation error display
- Touch target compliance
- Label associations
- Keyboard navigation through forms
- Loading states during submission

### Part E: Bug Fixes ✅
#### Holographic Effects Fix
- Fixed CSS perspective issue in Card Detail page
- Changed from class-based to inline style for perspective
- Ensured proper 3D transformations work
- Maintained all holographic overlays and animations
- Rainbow shimmer effect preserved
- Particle effects for ultra-rare cards functional

## Technical Achievements

### Code Quality

- Mobile viewports (iPhone, Android)
- Visual regression with screenshots
- Video recording on failures
- Parallel test execution

## Files Created/Modified

### New Components
- `/components/ui/Select.tsx` (390 lines)
- `/components/ui/Checkbox.tsx` (220 lines)
- `/components/ui/Radio.tsx` (280 lines)

### Performance Files
- `/next.config.js` - Enhanced webpack configuration
- `/public/sw.js` - Service Worker implementation

### Test Files
