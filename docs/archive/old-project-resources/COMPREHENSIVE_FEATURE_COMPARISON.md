---

## CONCLUSION

The TypeScript migration has introduced significant regressions, with approximately 35% of features either broken or degraded. While the codebase is now fully TypeScript, the migration prioritized type conversion over functionality preservation. 

Critical business features like battle simulation, pack opening, and real price data are non-functional. The mobile experience has significantly degraded, and many quality-of-life features were lost.

Recovery is possible but requires systematic fixes starting with P0 issues. The provided roadmap should restore functionality within 6-8 weeks with focused effort.
