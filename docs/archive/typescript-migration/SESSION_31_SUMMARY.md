# Session 31 Summary - Test Fix Progress

## Date: July 20, 2025

## Initial State
- Tests Passing: 219/1120 (19.6%) 
- Major Issue: Type Effectiveness page bug causing 432 test failures

## Work Completed

### 1. Fixed Critical Type Effectiveness Bug
- **Issue**: `typeInfo.pokemon` and `typeInfo.moves` were undefined, causing `.slice()` errors
- **Fix**: Added null checks with fallback to empty arrays
- **Impact**: Eliminated 432 console errors

### 2. Added Type Endpoint Mocking
- **Issue**: Type effectiveness tests were hitting real PokeAPI
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive type endpoint mocking in `tests/helpers/api-mock.ts`
- **Details**: 
  - Added mock data for fire, water, grass, ghost, normal types
  - Added default relationships for all other types
  - Fixed route pattern from `**/api/v2/type/**` to `**/api/v2/type/*`

### 3. Fixed Type Effectiveness Display
- **Issue**: Tests expected "2x", "0.5x" format but code showed just numbers
- **Fix**: Updated display format from `2` to `2x`
- **Impact**: Type effectiveness tests now properly validate multipliers

## Results
- Type effectiveness test suite improved from 14/60 (23%) to ~49/60 (82%) passing
- Fixed the critical bug that was causing 432 failures across the test suite
- Overall test improvement expected to be significant (300+ tests fixed)

## Next Steps
1. Run full test suite to measure total impact
2. Address remaining test failures in priority order:
   - 6 test suites with 0% pass rate
   - Mobile viewport issues (35 failures)
   - Performance timeouts (96 tests)
   - Console errors (176 failures)

## Key Learning
The single Type Effectiveness bug was cascading and causing failures across many test suites. Fixing core functionality issues has outsized impact on test pass rates.
