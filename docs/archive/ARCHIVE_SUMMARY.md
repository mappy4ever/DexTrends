## Why These Were Archived

1. **Completed Projects**: Documentation for projects that have been successfully completed
2. **Superseded Information**: Older guides replaced by newer implementations
3. **Historical Context**: Valuable for reference but not for active development
4. **Redundant Documentation**: Multiple versions of the same information consolidated
