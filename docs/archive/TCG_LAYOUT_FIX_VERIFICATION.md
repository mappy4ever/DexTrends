## Manual Verification Checklist

### Visual Layout
- [ ] Cards display in a denser grid (more columns)
- [ ] Mobile: 3 columns
- [ ] Tablet: 6 columns  
- [ ] Desktop: 10-12 columns
- [ ] No flashing or fade-in animations when cards load
- [ ] Card spacing is tighter (smaller gaps)

### Loading Behavior
- [ ] Initial page load shows ~100-150 cards immediately
- [ ] NO automatic background loading occurs
- [ ] "Load More Cards" button appears if more cards exist
- [ ] Clicking button shows loading spinner at bottom
- [ ] New cards load without page refresh or flashing
- [ ] Loading spinner disappears after cards load

### Scrolling
- [ ] Page scrolls smoothly without height restrictions
- [ ] Can scroll to see all loaded cards
- [ ] For large sets (>100 cards), virtualization works properly
- [ ] No fixed 800px height limit on grid

### Performance
- [ ] Page loads quickly without multiple re-renders
- [ ] No console errors about hooks or React issues
- [ ] Statistics update without causing card grid to re-render

## Test URLs
- Small set: `/tcgsets/sv-p` (Promo cards)
- Medium set: `/tcgsets/sv4` (~200 cards)
- Large set: `/tcgsets/sv5` (Surging Sparks, ~250+ cards)

## Expected Console Output
- Should see: "More cards available, user can load them manually"
- Should NOT see: "starting background load..."
- Should NOT see continuous loading messages

## Browser Compatibility

- [ ] Chrome
