# Archived Documentation

## Why These Are Archived

Multiple documentation files were created during different Claude sessions, leading to confusion with conflicting phase numbers and plans. These have been archived in favor of a single source of truth.

## Current Source of Truth

**USE THIS**: `/CLEANUP_STATUS_TRUTH.md`

This is the ONLY document that accurately reflects what's been done and what's next.

## Archived Documents (For Reference Only)

### Conflicting Phase Plans
- `PROJECT_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` - Had 7-phase plan
- `PROJECT_CLEAN_MASTER_PLAN.md` - Had 6-phase plan  
- Various completion reports with different numbering

### Investigation Reports (Still Valid)
- `CRITICAL_FINDINGS_REPORT.md` - Valid findings
- `MASTER_INVENTORY_PHASE_0.md` - Valid investigation
- `PHASE_1_INVESTIGATION_COMPLETE.md` - Valid analysis

### Emergency Fix Documentation (Still Valid)
- `EMERGENCY_FIX_LOG.md` - Accurate record of fix
- `PRODUCTION_ROUTES.md` - Still the source of truth for routes

## Why The Confusion Happened

1. Two different Claude sessions were running
2. Each created their own phase numbering system
3. Both were doing similar work with different documentation
4. Git commits show the actual work done, not what was planned

## Lessons Learned

1. Always check git history for actual changes
2. Verify file existence before trusting documentation
3. Use a single source of truth document
4. Update documentation immediately after changes
