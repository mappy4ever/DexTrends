# Current Project Status

## PROJECT CLEAN - Where We Are Now

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Setup & Documentation - COMPLETE
- All documentation created
- Analysis tools built
- Backup created: `backup-before-cleanup`

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Safe Renames - COMPLETE
**Component Renames Done:**
- ‚úÖ GymLeaderCard ‚Üí GymLeaderTile
- ‚úÖ CircularGymLeaderCard ‚Üí GymLeaderAvatar
- ‚úÖ CircularPokemonCard ‚Üí PokemonAvatar
- ‚úÖ EliteFourCard ‚Üí EliteFourTile
- ‚úÖ ChampionCard ‚Üí ChampionTile
- ‚úÖ PokemonCardItem ‚Üí PokemonTile

**Note on PokemonTile**: This is correctly named - it's a tile that displays a Pokemon (not "PokemonCardTile" which would be confusing)

**Routes Not Changed Yet:**
- `/tcgexpansions` still exists (not changed to `/tcg-expansions` yet)
- This can be done later if needed

### ‚è≥ Phase 3: Fix TypeScript Errors - READY TO START
**Current Status:**
- Main codebase: ‚úÖ Clean (no errors!)
- Experimental pages: ~20 errors (can be ignored or fixed)
- These are in `pages/_experimental/` folder

### üìä Current Metrics
- **Dev Server**: ‚úÖ Running successfully
- **TypeScript**: ‚úÖ Clean (main code)
- **Tests**: Ready to run
- **Routes Working**: All tested and functional

## What's Actually Left

### Immediate (Phase 3)
Since main TypeScript is clean, we could:
1. Skip to Phase 4 (Clean Debug Code)
2. Or clean up experimental pages
3. Or continue with route standardization

### Remaining Phases
- **Phase 4**: Clean Debug Code (461 instances)
- **Phase 5**: Process Unused Variables (1090 items)
- **Phase 6**: Archive Duplicate Pages
- **Phase 7**: Final Validation

## Key Achievements So Far
1. ‚úÖ Solved Card vs Tile confusion
2. ‚úÖ All component renames complete
3. ‚úÖ Zero functionality broken
4. ‚úÖ TypeScript clean in main codebase
5. ‚úÖ Dev server running without issues

## Decision Points
1. **Route rename**: Should we rename `/tcgexpansions` ‚Üí `/tcg-expansions`?
   - Pro: Consistency with kebab-case
   - Con: Might break existing links
   
2. **Experimental pages**: Fix or ignore?
   - They're not used in production
   - Could be deleted or fixed

## Next Command Options

### Option 1: Skip to Phase 4 (Debug Code)
```bash
grep -r "console\." --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" | grep -v "logger" | wc -l
```

### Option 2: Fix Experimental Pages
```bash
rm -rf pages/_experimental  # If not needed
```

### Option 3: Continue Route Standardization
```bash
mv pages/tcgexpansions.tsx pages/tcg-expansions.tsx
mv pages/tcgexpansions pages/tcg-expansions
```

## Summary
**Phase 2 is actually COMPLETE!** The component renames are all done. TypeScript is clean in the main codebase. We're ready to move forward with whatever makes most sense for the project.
