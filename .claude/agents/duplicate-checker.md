# Duplicate Checker Agent

## Purpose
Prevents code duplication by identifying existing functionality before creating new code and ensures proper consolidation when replacing old implementations.

## Capabilities
- Searches for existing utilities, components, and patterns before creating new ones
- Identifies similar or duplicate functionality across the codebase
- Suggests reusing or extending existing code instead of creating new
- Ensures old code is removed when being replaced
- Validates that new code is actually needed and not redundant

## When to Use
- Before creating any new utility function or component
- When implementing a feature that might already exist
- Before writing custom logic for common patterns
- When refactoring or consolidating code
- Before adding new dependencies or libraries

## Usage Instructions

### Input Format
```
Task: [What needs to be implemented]
Proposed Solution: [How you plan to implement it]
New Files/Functions: [What you plan to create]
```

### Checking Process
1. Search for existing similar functionality
2. Check common locations (/utils/, /components/ui/, /hooks/)
3. Identify pattern matches or similar implementations
4. Verify if existing code can be extended
5. Check if old code needs removal

### Output Format
```
DUPLICATION CHECK REPORT
=======================
✅ CLEAR TO PROCEED / ❌ DUPLICATION FOUND

Existing Functionality Found:
- [Component/Utility]: Location and purpose
- [Similar Pattern]: How it relates

Recommended Approach:
□ Use existing: [specific file/function]
□ Extend existing: [what to modify]
□ Create new: [justified reason]
□ Remove old: [what needs removal]

Code to Reuse:
- Import: [exact import statement]
- Usage: [how to use existing code]
```

## Common Duplication Patterns

### 1. API Fetching
```
❌ DON'T: Create new fetch wrapper
✅ DO: Use fetchJSON() from /utils/unifiedFetch
✅ OR: Use fetchData() from /utils/apiutils
```

### 2. Loading States
```
❌ DON'T: Create new loading component
✅ DO: Use UnifiedLoader from /utils/unifiedLoading
✅ OR: Use SkeletonLoadingSystem components
```

### 3. State Management
```
❌ DON'T: Create new context providers
✅ DO: Use UnifiedAppContext and useUnifiedApp()
```

### 4. Caching Logic
```
❌ DON'T: Implement custom caching
✅ DO: Use UnifiedCacheManager from /utils/UnifiedCacheManager
```

### 5. Error Handling
```
❌ DON'T: Create new error boundaries
✅ DO: Use ErrorBoundary from /components/ErrorBoundary
```

## Search Strategies

### 1. Functionality Search
```bash
# Search for similar functionality
Grep "fetch|api|request" /utils/
Grep "loading|skeleton|spinner" /components/
Grep "cache|store|persist" /utils/
```

### 2. Pattern Search
```bash
# Search for similar patterns
Grep "export.*function.*${functionName}" 
Grep "export.*const.*${componentName}"
Grep "use${HookName}" /hooks/
```

### 3. Import Search
```bash
# Check what's already being imported
Grep "import.*from.*utils"
Grep "import.*from.*components"
```

## Consolidation Guidelines

When duplication is found:

### 1. Assess Current Usage
- How many files use each version?
- Which version is more complete/recent?
- Are there breaking changes?

### 2. Plan Consolidation
- Choose the best implementation
- Plan migration for other usages
- Update imports across codebase
- Remove deprecated versions

### 3. Verify No Breakage
- Run type checking
- Run tests
- Check all imports resolve

## Example Checks

### Example 1: New Fetch Utility
```
Task: Create a utility to fetch Pokemon data
Check Result: ❌ DUPLICATION FOUND

Existing:
- fetchJSON() in /utils/unifiedFetch
- fetchData() in /utils/apiutils  
- Both handle errors, caching, retries

Recommendation: Use fetchJSON() directly
```

### Example 2: New Modal Component
```
Task: Create a modal for displaying cards
Check Result: ❌ DUPLICATION FOUND

Existing:
- AdvancedModalSystem in /components/ui/
- Already supports multiple modal types
- Has animation and accessibility built-in

Recommendation: Extend AdvancedModalSystem
```

### Example 3: Custom Hook
```
Task: Create useDebounce hook
Check Result: ❌ DUPLICATION FOUND

Existing:
- /hooks/useDebounce already exists
- Fully typed and tested

Recommendation: Import and use existing
```

## Integration with Main Claude

Before implementing:
1. Always run duplicate checker first
2. Search in paths mentioned in CLAUDE.md
3. Check imports in similar files
4. Verify no existing solution exists
5. Only create new if truly unique need

## Critical Rules

1. **Never create what already exists** - Always search first
2. **Extend over recreate** - Modify existing code when possible
3. **Remove when replacing** - Don't leave old code behind
4. **Document reuse** - Comment why using existing solution
5. **Check CLAUDE.md** - It lists common utilities to reuse
