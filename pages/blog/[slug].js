              Every great business starts with a questionâ€”mine was,{" "}
              <i>"How can data be used to truly transform the way businesses operate?"</i>
            </p>
            <p>
              From my early days in university, I was fascinated by the ways data could reveal patterns,
              predict trends, and ultimately drive smarter decisions. That curiosity led me to a career where
              Iâ€™ve had the privilege of designing and implementing business intelligence (BI) solutions that
              have reshaped operations in healthcare, non-profits, and corporate enterprises.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether it was optimizing reporting systems for the Ministry of Health, leading data infrastructure
              modernization at non-profits, or creating analytics solutions that unlocked millions in funding
              for critical public health programs, my focus has always been on{" "}
              <b>turning raw data into meaningful action</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, with PakePoint Analytics, Iâ€™m bringing that same strategic mindset and technical expertise to
              businesses looking to <b>leverage data for growth, efficiency, and innovation</b>.

            <p>
              In todayâ€™s fast-paced digital economy, businesses that fail to adapt <b>fall behind</b>. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve
              dedicated my career to helping organizations modernize their data infrastructure, streamline reporting
              processes, and unlock insights that drive real impact.
