    - text: Biography
  - paragraph: Professor Kukui is unique among professors for his dual life as both a researcher and a professional Battle Royal wrestler under the masked identity of "The Masked Royal." His research focuses on Pokémon moves and their effects. Kukui's passion for Pokémon battling led him to establish the first Pokémon League in the Alola region, bringing the traditional League structure to the island region. His hands-on approach to research often involves taking attacks from Pokémon directly to study their effects. Living with his wife Professor Burnet, Kukui embodies the laid-back Alolan lifestyle while maintaining scientific rigor. His research on Z-Moves has been instrumental in understanding these powerful techniques unique to Alola.
